# Design at Scale: Atomic Design

---

## Why do we care about Atomic Design?

- Systems are hard to hold in your head at once
- We need ways to thing about systems in smaller parts
- If we make the small bits good, and make the small bits play well with other small bits, we can put those bits together and trust the result

## What is Atomic Design?

- [atomicdesign.bradfrost.com](//atomicdesign.bradfrost.com)
- It's just a design methodology that a lot of people (icluding me) like

> A methodology is a system of methods used in a particular area of study or activity

- It's a way of thinking/reasoning about a certain topic
- It's a starting point to guide our thinking and set the tone of thought
- Ideally, by the end of this program, you will have your own way of thinking
